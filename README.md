# üêç AE1205 Programming and Scientific Computing in Python for AE1 (2018/19 Q4)

This GitHub page contains my version of the answers to the in class assignments. If you disagree with my approach/have a better idea, please let me know. PLEASE do not copy these files one on one, as that is fraud. Just use them as a reference and write your own code.

The link to Brightspace for this course can be found [here](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/home/133502).

## üìÅ File/folder structure

The `assignments` folder contains all of the assignments from class. In every assignment folder, there is a folder called `program`, which contains a file called `program.py`. This file is the solution to the assignment. The other files in the `program` folder are there to support this main file. Every assignment folder also has a file called `README.md` where you can see what the output should look like.

## ‚ú® How I write code

Since Python does not require you to explicitly define the type of the variable upon declaration, I use the following format to keep it clear what type of variable is being dealt with:

* Integers (0,1,2...), example `iAmountOfApples`
* Floats (3.1415...), example `fPi`
* Strings ("Python"), example `sLoremIpsum`
* Booleans (true/false), example: `bIsReady`
* Arrays ([1],[2]), example `arrNumbers`
* Objects (color), example `currentColor`

## üí° Other projects

### HacBookPro

Currently I am working on trying to make the HP Zbook Studio G5 laptops, the ones we could get with discount via the university, Mac OSX compatible. At the moment of writing, I have a working version with the only defects being that I can't see the battery status and that there is some form of color banding. If you would like to help figure out a way to fix these final issues, I would really appreciate it!
