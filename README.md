# AE1205 Programming and Scientific Computing in Python for AE1 (2018/19 Q4)

This GitHub page contains my version of the answers to the in class assignments. If you disagree with my approach/have a better idea, please let me know.

## File/folder structure

The assignments folder contains all of the assignments from class. In every assignment folder, there is one file called `assignment-x.py` where `x` is the assignment number. The other files in there are used in this `assignment-x.py` file.

## How I write code

Since Python does not require you to explicitly define the type of the variable upon declaration, I use the following format to keep it clear what type of variable is being dealt with:

* Integers (0,1,2...), example `iAmountOfApples`
* Floats (3.1415...), example `fPi`
* Strings ("Python"), example `sLoremIpsum`
* Booleans (true/false), example: `bIsReady`
