# AE1205 Programming and Scientific Computing in Python for AE1 (2018/19 Q4)

This GitHub page contains my version of the answers to the in class assignments. If you disagree with my approach/have a better idea, please let me know.

The link to Brightspace for this course can be found [here](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/home/133502).

## File/folder structure

The assignments folder contains all of the assignments from class. In every assignment folder, there is one file called `assignment-x.py` where `x` is the assignment number. The other files in there are used in the `assignment-x.py` file.

## How I write code

Since Python does not require you to explicitly define the type of the variable upon declaration, I use the following format to keep it clear what type of variable is being dealt with:

* Integers (0,1,2...), example `iAmountOfApples`
* Floats (3.1415...), example `fPi`
* Strings ("Python"), example `sLoremIpsum`
* Booleans (true/false), example: `bIsReady`
* Arrays ([1],[2]), example `arrNumbers`

## Other projects

### HacBookPro

Currently I am working on trying to make the HP Zbook Studio G5 laptops, the ones we could get with discount via the university, Mac OSX compatible. At the moment of writing, I have a working version with the only defects being that I can't see the battery status and that there is some form of color banding. If you would like to help figure out a way to fix these final issues, I would really appreciate it!
